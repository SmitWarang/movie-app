## Project Description: Movie Search App

The Movie Search App is a simple yet feature-rich web application designed to allow users to search for movies by their title, view detailed information about each movie, and seamlessly navigate between the search results and movie details. Built using React and Vite, the app leverages the public OMDB API to fetch accurate movie information in real time. This app provides an intuitive user experience with a clean, responsive interface, making it an ideal solution for movie enthusiasts looking to discover and explore their favorite films.

### Key Features
1. Search Movies by Title  
   The app provides a powerful search functionality that allows users to search for movies by their titles. When a user enters a keyword in the search bar, the app fetches a list of matching movies from the OMDB API and displays them as cards, each containing the movie poster, title, and release year.

2. Movie Details  
   Users can click on any movie card to view detailed information about that movie. This includes:
   - Title  
   - Release Year  
   - Plot  
   - Director  
   - Actors  
   - Poster  
   - Additional metadata, such as the language and genre.  

   The movie details are presented in a well-structured card format for easy readability.

3. Seamless Navigation  
   The app provides a smooth navigation experience. Users can return to the search results at any time by clicking the Back button in the movie details view.

4. Responsive Design  
   The app is fully responsive, ensuring that users have an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout adjusts gracefully, making the app accessible and visually appealing on screens of all sizes.

### Technologies Used
1. Frontend Framework: React  
   The app is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for a modular and component-based architecture.  

2. Build Tool: Vite  
   Vite is used for fast development and optimized builds, ensuring a seamless development experience and high-performance app.  

3. API Integration: OMDB API  
   The app interacts with the OMDB API to fetch movie data. By using the APIâ€™s search functionality, the app retrieves a list of movies matching the search query and detailed metadata for individual movies.

4. Styling: CSS  
   Custom CSS is used to style the app, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface. Attention has been given to visual consistency, hover effects, button styles, and responsiveness.

### How It Works
1. Users start by entering the title of a movie in the search bar.  
2. The app fetches and displays a list of movies matching the search query, with key details such as title, poster, and release year.  
3. Clicking on a movie card takes the user to a detailed view where they can learn more about the selected movie.  
4. A Back button enables users to return to the list of search results and continue exploring.
